Build a modular Project Matching feature that uses AI to automatically assign an invoice to a project, but only if the invoice is not flagged as petty cash. Follow the steps below incrementally:

🔹 Step 1 — Scaffold the Project Matching System
Create a new route /invoices/:id/match-project

Add a backend service /api/invoices/:id/match-project

Load invoice metadata: project_name, address, city, total_amount

Fetch the list of validated projects from the Project Validation database

Display invoice info and project candidates on the page

🔹 Step 2 — Add Petty Cash Filtering (Pre-Match Gate)
Check invoice total against a user-defined petty cash threshold (e.g. 500)

If invoice is petty cash:

Set petty_cash: true in invoice

Skip project matching UI

Show a banner: “Petty cash invoice — no project matching required”

Else:

Continue to AI project matching

🔹 Step 3 — Implement AI Project Matching
Build a backend function matchProjectToInvoice(invoice, projectList, threshold)

Compare:

project_name, address, city from the invoice

Against each project in the DB

Use GPT or embeddings to generate a confidence score (0–100) for each match

Return top 3 matches sorted by score

🔹 Step 4 — Confidence Threshold Controls
Add a slider or input on the UI where user defines the minimum confidence required to auto-match (default: 80%)

If best match exceeds threshold:

Auto-assign project and show confirmation:
“Matched to Project XYZ (confidence: 92%)”

If no match exceeds threshold:

Show top 3 suggestions with manual selection buttons

🔹 Step 5 — Manual Matching UI & Fallbacks
Allow user to:

Select one of the suggested projects

Search/select from all validated projects

Add a new project if needed

Store user override in match_status = "manual" and log who matched it

🔹 Step 6 — Store Match Metadata
In the invoice record, save:

json
Copiar
Editar
{
  "matched_project_id": "...",
  "match_confidence": 91,
  "matched_by": "AI" | "user",
  "match_status": "auto" | "manual" | "no_match",
  "petty_cash": true | false
}
🔹 Step 7 — UI Integration
Left panel: invoice metadata

Right panel: match confidence and suggestions

Show match badge in invoice list/detail view:

“Project Matched ✅” / “Manual Match” / “Petty Cash 🪙” / “No Match ❌”
